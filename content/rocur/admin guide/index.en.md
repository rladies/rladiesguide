## Account Admin

The admin team for the [We Are R-Ladies Bluesky account](https://bsky.app/profile/weare.rladies.org) is made up of members of the R-Ladies community. The team usually consists of 1 to 4 people, with responsibilities rotating on a monthly basis. Being an admin is a fantastic opportunity to connect with R-Ladies from around the world while facilitating an online community resource.

## Primary Responsibilities
The responsibilities of the account admin are to:

-   Coordinate and grant Bluesky account access to curators

-   Provide instructions to curators and answer questions

-   Update and expand on rotating curator (RoCur) documentation

-   Recruit R-Ladies to be curators for the account

## Recruiting Curators

RoCur admins can recruit potential curators in a variety of ways:

-   Messaging the R-Ladies Community Slack

-   Reaching out to organizers of different R-Ladies chapters

-   Posting a general call via the [R-Ladies](https://bsky.app/profile/rladies.org) or [We Are R-Ladies](https://bsky.app/profile/weare.rladies.org) Bluesky accounts

-   Contacting specific individuals

In line with [R-Ladies' mission](https://rladies.org/about-us/mission/), this account aims to spotlight minority genders (including but not limited to cis/trans women, trans men, non-binary individuals) and their great work in R. Featured curators should come from a diversity of professions and have a range of experiences in R, from novice to expert. Currently, we do not have a protocol for individuals to curate more than once.

We also aim for this RoCur account to be a sustainable initiative. Therefore, there is no pressure for RoCur admins to have curators lined up every single week. Additionally, RoCur admins are allowed to identify weeks during the year for the account to go on hiatus (i.e., an extended period with no curators).

## Admin Procedures
