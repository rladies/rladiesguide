### 8. How do I schedule a post on the We Are R-Ladies Bluesky channel?

These instructions assume you've already requested access to Buffer. If you haven't yet and would like access, please contact an admin to set up an account. There are a few ways to schedule posts, but here's one straightforward method:

1.  Log into Buffer.

2.  Click on your profile icon (top right), then ensure that the **R-Ladies** workspace is selected.

3.  In the **Publish** tab, find the **Channels** list and select the **We Are R-Ladies Bluesky** channel.

4.  Click the **+ New Post** button in the top-right corner.

5.  Use the text field to write your post. You can also add images, links and other media. If you're using Buffer during your curation week, skip to Step 7.

6.  **Prior to your curation week**, you won't have posting permissions, but you can click on **Save as Draft** to save your work. You can also click **Set Time** to specify when the post will be published.

    -   Just before your curation week, you'll be granted posting access. At that point, go to the **Drafts** tab, click on **Add to Queue** to add the post to the next available time slot in the posting schedule. If you want to edit the content or set a specific time for publication, click the **pencil icon**.

7.  To schedule or publish the post, choosing one of the following options. To assess more scheduling options, click the drop-down arrow.

    -   **Add to Queue:** Adds the post to the next available time slot in the posting schedule.

    -   **Share Now:** Publishes the post immediately.

    -   **Share Next:** Schedules the post to be published next, bumping other scheduled posts down.

    -   **Schedule Post:** Allows you to choose a specific date and time for publication.

### **9. Are there any limitations to using Buffer?**

As of April 2025:

1.  You can't respond to replies directly from Buffer!
2.  There's no built-in tool for searching and adding GIFs. You'll need to look up GIFs separately and drag and drop them into the post draft.
3.  Unfortunately, there's no feature for adding alt text to GIFs.
4.  When typing "\@" to mention someone, there's no drop-down suggestions for Bluesky handles. You'll need to double-check the handle name on Bluesky to ensure accuracy.

In summary, if your posts are mostly text and static images, Buffer works well. However, for posts including other media, you might prefer drafting in Buffer and then manually copy and pasting into Bluesky's built-in posting feature.
