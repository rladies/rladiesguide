## About  
  
The **[R-Ladies RoCur (Rotating Curation)](https://bsky.app/profile/weare.rladies.org)** is a social media handle that is running on Bluesky that will feature an awesome R-Lady each week. This account is run by R-Ladies Global.      
  
   
## Objectives  
  
1. To encourage and maintain Bluesky engagement within the R-Ladies community.    
2. To spotlight female and minority genders (including but not limited to cis/trans women, trans men, non-binary, genderqueer, agender) and their great work in R.   
  
## How It Works  
  
Every week, a different R-Lady takes over our Bluesky account to talk about the work they do in R. Featured curators come from a diversity of professions and have a range of experiences in R, from novice to expert.  
  
If you are interested in becoming a curator, see our *Be a Curator* section (below) and [sign up here](https://airtable.com/appjkZZgtF0iEWFjx/pagqsAma1WmUYxa9j/form).  
  
Check out [@weare.rladies.org](https://bsky.app/profile/weare.rladies.org) every Monday for a new curator!

## Be a Curator! 
  
We are always looking for R-users to be a featured curator for our account! 

We welcome curators:

* of all experience levels 
* of all professional backgrounds
* of all locations
* of any native language (curation may be conducted in any language; English is not required) 

Featured curators must meet the following criteria:  
  
* Curators must identify as a [gender minority](https://guide.rladies.org/about/mission/) (including but not limited to cis/trans women, trans men, non-binary, genderqueer, agender).  
* Curators do not need to be affiliated with R-Ladies; however, curators do need to register in the [R-Ladies directory](https://rladies.org/directory/) if they haven’t yet. 
* Curators must be individuals (i.e. an R-Ladies Chapter cannot be a featured curator; however, an organizer from a local chapter may curate and tweet about chapter events).

By signing on to be a curator of @weare.rladies.org you agree to our Curator Agreement that is outlined in our [RoCur Curator Guide](https://guide.rladies.org/rocur/guide/).

## Curator Nomination

**[Curator Nomination Form](https://airtable.com/appFIBzsk2AxWlGMt/pagfezjuCxohikOOa/form)**  
  
Do you know an R-Lady who you think would be a great curator? We accept nominations for curators via our [nomination form](https://airtable.com/appFIBzsk2AxWlGMt/pagfezjuCxohikOOa/form). 

Anyone is welcome to nominate curators - you do not need to be affiliated with R-Ladies to nominate an individual to curate for @weare.rladies.org. Multiple nominations from a single nominator is also permitted. @weare.rladies.org administrators will review nominations and invite nominees to curate.

## Repeat Curation

Individuals may sign up for repeat curation if it has been at least two years since their previous curation. Scheduling priority is given to new curators. For repeat curation, please complete the sign up form again so that we may capture any updated information about you.
