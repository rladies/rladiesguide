## About  
  
The **[R-Ladies RoCur (Rotating Curation)](https://twitter.com/WeAreRLadies)** is a twitter handle that will feature an awesome R-Lady each week. This account is run by R-Ladies Global.      
  
   
## Objectives  
  
1. To encourage and maintain Twitter engagement within the R-Ladies community.    
2. To spotlight female and minority genders (including but not limited to cis/trans women, trans men, non-binary, genderqueer, agender) and their great work in R.   
  
## How It Works  
  
Every week, a different R-Lady takes over our twitter account to talk about the work they do in R. Featured curators come from a diversity of professions and have a range of experiences in R, from novice to expert.  
  
If you are interested in becoming a curator, see our *Be a Curator* section (below) and [sign up here](https://forms.gle/4Z6EMbDzRyFQsB6C8).  
  
Check out [@WeAreRLadies](https://twitter.com/WeAreRLadies) every Monday for a new curator!

## Be a Curator! 
  
We are always looking for R-users to be a featured curator for our account! Everyone is welcome; R-Ladies encourages R-users of all professional backgrounds and experience levels to curate this account. Additionally, individuals do not need to be affiliated with R-Ladies to curate. Featured curators must meet the following criteria:  
  
* Curators must identify as [cis/trans women, trans men, non-binary, genderqueer, agender](https://guide.rladies.org/rocur/about/).  
* Curators do not need to be affiliated with R-Ladies; however, curators need to register in the [R-Ladies directory](https://rladies.org/directory/) if they haven’t yet.   
* Curators must be individuals (i.e. an R-Ladies Chapter cannot be a featured curator; however, an organizer from a local chapter may curate and tweet about chapter events).   
* By signing on to be a curator of @WeAreRLadies you agree to our Curator Agreement that is outlined in our [RoCur Curator Guide](https://guide.rladies.org/rocur/guide/).

:two: Send a photo to `WeAre@rladies.org` that will be used as the profile pic of the account during your curation week.

:four: _*The week before you are scheduled to curate*_: Account administrators will send you an email with specific info about curating and show you the infographic that will be posted the Sunday before you curate.
