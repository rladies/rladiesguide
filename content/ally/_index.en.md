## How can you help R-Ladies as an ally?

First, please read our [mission](/about/mission/) and [code of conduct](/about/coc/) to understand what R-Ladies is about.

Then, you can support your [local chapter](https://rladies.org) with a free venue and sponsorship for food and drink.

Furthermore, you can volunteer as an [abstract/proposal reviewer](/comm/abstract-review/).

Besides, you can donate to the global R-Ladies organization.

You can also advocate by promoting our [directory](http://rladies.org/directory/) and in general by giving opportunities to R-Ladies at conferences, for jobs, etc.

Please also check out these other organizations

* For larger amounts, we would recommend sending an email to `finance@rladies.org` and we can provide you the routing/account number for a direct wire transfer, or if you are in the US and prefer to send a check, we can provide you our non-profit HQ address in Oakland, California.

## How can you help R-Lady as an ally organization?

If you wish to partner with the R-Ladies global organization besides donating, please make sure to read our [mission](/about/mission) (and [code of conduct](/about/coc/) ) in particular regarding not commercial agendas, and get in touch with the global leadership via an email to `leadership@rladies.org`.

Do *not* use R-Ladies name to potentially help secure funding (promising benefits to R-Ladies) without getting in touch with the R-Ladies global team first (`info@rladies.org`) so we can provide input and potential approval. We need a chance to assess the alignment of your project with our mission.
