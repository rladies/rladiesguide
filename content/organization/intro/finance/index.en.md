We do not want you to spend your personal money on your local chapter!

## Local sponsors

If you find a local sponsors, at the moment since there is no formal structure for receiving funds, it is best if the sponsor pays directly for a need of your chapter, like food at the next event or accomodation for a guest speaker.
The sponsor might also want to e.g. put a room at your disposal for free.

There is the option of paying from your own pocket and have the sponsor reimburse you but that is riskier.

We are piloting using [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/) -- the results of the pilot are not in yet. 

### How to find sponsors?

You might try to cold email (i.e. reach out to, without knowing them) local IT companies you think might be interested in R-Ladies mission.

You might try to use your personal contacts such as current or past employers, and those of the members of the meetup who could ask their own employers to provide a room for meetups for instance.

You might also hear of special call for proposals of diversity initiatives where your chapter could apply. 

In all cases, it can help to tell the members of your chapter to be on the lookout and help you not miss opportunities.

### How to convince sponsors?

What are our strenghts?

* our focus on women and gender minorities;
* events being free.

You could hand out flyers (for instance see [R-Ladies Cotonou's flyers](https://github.com/sbnadejda/flyers_R-LadiesCtn)), and send (cold) emails.
See email template below, just given for information as you can write your own! This email template was adapted from an email graciously shared by R-Ladies Philly.

```markdown
Dear [Name],
I am contacting you about the possibility of supporting the local chapter of R-Ladies [chapter name and online presence]. R-Ladies is a world-wide organization that promotes gender diversity in the data science community. As the [chapter name] chapter, we actively share and exchange knowledge with 100+ other chapters across the world, and bring together [usual number of attendees] members each [event frequency] for networking and knowledge sharing events. Since starting in [creation date], we’ve grown to [number of meetup members] members, and have set the groundwork for [positive phrase, e.g. "civic engagement" if you paired with non-profits, "community building among data scientists", etc].
If you are unfamiliar, R is an open source programming language for statistical computing that is widely used in many sectors. We are organizing [event types e.g. workshops] for women and underrepresented genders interested in R with topics like beginning R, R/Shiny, and statistical methods. [Add other events here if relevant e.g. bookclubs, networking events]
Continuing these efforts to increase diversity through opportunities in data science in [chapter location] will require time and resources (e.g. food, location space, online hosting, access to experts). We are committed to dedicating our time to this mission, and we would welcome the opportunity to partner with [company] to develop these avenues further.
[Here is a good place to customize - are you specifically interested in this sponsor hosting an event? Providing food for an event? Providing printing services?]
Best,
[your name]
```

Now as regards to the subject of the email, you want it to

* convey what's in the email ("Partner with R-Ladies Philly");
* not look spammy;
* possibly explain R-Ladies, maybe using keywords like "feminist", "R", "data science"...

### How to thank sponsors?

* listing them as sponsors in the promotion of activities they supported;
* a short time slot at the beginning of a meetup to present their company;
* etc.
