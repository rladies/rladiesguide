[General info about emails for R-Ladies chapters](/organization/tech/accounts/#e-mail).

Since November 2022 R-Ladies migrated to Google Work Space, and e-mail accounts are now handled using gmail infrastructure. 
All R-Ladies chapters use the _@rladies.org_ domain. 

If you need help to manage your email account there are [official google instructions on how to use a Gmail account](https://support.google.com/mail?sjid=12348347883239577326-SA#topic=3394212)

### A new account

After we have created your chapter email account you will receive an email like this:

_Subjetc: You have a new Google account for R-Ladies_

_Welcome to your new Google Account for R-Ladies_

_Hello,_

_You have a new Google Account with the R-Ladies organization._

_Sign in to your Google Account to access the Google services your organization provides._
_If your organization has Google Workspace, Google services may include business-grade versions of_ 
_Google Drive, Gmail, and other Google services you can use to collaborate with your team._

_Your username: chaptername@rladies.org_

_Password: Click Sign in below to set your password and sign in. To keep your account secure, follow these password guidelines._

_[button with the link to login for the first time]_

_For your security, the reset password link expires after 48 hours. After that, please contact your administrator for your password._
