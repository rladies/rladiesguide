## Slack

* Once you initiate the process of becoming an organizer by sending an email to info [at] rladies [dot] org, you will be sent and invite to the [R-Ladies Organizers' Slack](http://r-ladies.slack.com).
* Please add your city or chapter to your Slack profile.  
* You can create a channel on the global Slack for communication within the organizing team of your chapter,
  e.g., #rladies-san-francisco.
* There is a [global "all the R-Ladies" Slack](/comm/slack/).

### Etiquette for Slack

* Do not DM people based on their role except if they explicitely ask for it. **Prefer emails over DMs, and prefer official channels to people.** E.g. if you have an email issue, do not DM the person currently in charge of emails but instead send an email to `email@rladies.org`. Slack DMs create notifications hence fatigue; and are hard to keep track of.  

* As a volunteer receiving DMs, feel free to gracefully redirect them to the communication channel of your choice, or to indicate them to use another communication channel next time.


## Meetup  

Meetup is an online social platform used to announce events and manage registration to events.

* Ask Patricia (@patriLoto) or Claudia (@claudia) in the \#new\_chapters channel on Slack to help get your meetup.com group set up. R-Ladies [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/pro/rladies) accounts are paid for by the R-Ladies Organization using a grant from the [R-Consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/).

**Suggested Meetup Alignment**

-   "R-Ladies \[Location\] is part of a worldwide organization to
    promote Gender Diversity in the R community"

-   Intro text about your chapter meetup group

-   "Here is our Code of Conduct"

<!-- -->

-   "To find more details about R-Ladies global initiative by visiting
    [rladies.org](https://rladies.org/)"

-   "Follow us on twitter \@RLadies\[Location\] and \@RLadiesGlobal"

-   "Check out our [R-Ladies
    Github](https://github.com/rladies)"

-   Include statement about photography and filmings - this example is
    from London chapter:

> **"Photos, Films and all other media/recordings**: photographs and/or
video/other media will be taken at events held by this community. By
taking part in an R-Ladies London event you grant the community
organisers full rights to use the images resulting from the
photography/video filming/media, and any reproductions or adaptations
of the images for publicity, fundraising or other purposes to help
achieve the community's aims. This might include (but is not limited
to), the right to use them in their printed and online publicity,
social media, press releases and funding applications. If you do not
wish to be recorded in these media please inform a community
organiser."

-   Check that the URL is `meetup.com/rladies-location`.

{{% notice tip %}}
What if Meetup is not a popular platform in your country?
You might want to complement it with e.g. a mailing list after e.g. collecting email addresses via a form.
Make sure to comply with the local rules about personal data protection.

### Meetup members management

{{% notice warning %}}
R-Ladies mission focuses on women and other gender minorities. How can you ensure events are open to all whilst still foremost serving women and other gender minorities?

Please do be aware of the relevant Equality Legislation in your jurisdiction, e.g the Equality Act 2010 in the UK, when designing participation frameworks for the majority gender, to ensure your procedures are not infringing  local laws re. potential discrimination.

A good strategy might be to make your group private and ask candidates questions before they join

* Have them accept the code of conduct
* Remind that priority is given to minoritized genders, that everybody that identifies as such can enter and that cis-men are welcome if 1. they know already someone in, in that case they are asked to give the name of the person, who will act as a liaison just in case (like a ‚Äúgodmother‚Äù) 2. If they bring someone and agree to be their +1.

## E-Mail

* You can get a chapter email (yourcity\@rladies.org) which can be set up to forward to all the organisers of a chapter.  As of March 18, 2019, we are no longer issuing personal rladies.org emails (yourname\`@rladies.org) to organizers and will have chapter emails only.
   * Send an email (`email@rladies.org`) and volunteers in charge will set up your chapter email for you.  Please be patient, as these requests are processed weekly.
   * In the email, please send the personal email addresses for you and your co-organizers if you would like chapter email to forward there, otherwise, please be responsible for checking your chapter email via webmail or by setting it up on your email client.
* üö® **[VERY IMPORTANT]** **Your chapter email account should be used to set up any chapter social media accounts (e.g. Twitter, Instagram, etc).**
* Find instructions on [how use your rladies.org email in a mail client or within Gmail](/organization/email/).
* If you have an issue with emails send an email to `email@rladies.org` or try to crowd-source a solution in the `#email_etc_support` channel of the organizers slack.`

## GitHub

* There is a [global organisation](http://github.com/rladies) to collect all material
  related to R-Ladies in one place, so it's easier to know what's out there and get inspired by what other chapters did. Ask to be added as a member in the `#new_chapters` channel of the organizers slack.
* If you have presentations, please add them all to
  one repo for your chapter, e.g., `meetup-presentations_london`. If you have code for a
  workshop you can add it to the repository or ask us to create a new repository for that. Please name 
  it location_*, e.g., `london_20161130_h2o-and-r`.
