## A website for your chapter

Maybe keeping your chapter active on [social media](/organization/social-media/) is not the right fit, or enough, for you.

You are free to create a website for your chapter, you could ask other organizers what their experience with tools are.

Here are some examples of chapter websites for inspiration

* [R-Ladies NYC](http://www.rladiesnyc.org/)

* [R-Ladies Philly](https://www.rladiesphilly.org/)

* [R-Ladies Sydney](https://rladiessydney.org/)

* [R-Ladies Belo Horizonte](https://rladiesbh.com.br/)

Note that a GitHub repository could complement your website, cf [R-Ladies Seattle example](https://github.com/rladies-seattle/rladies-seattle-organizing).

## A website for R-Ladies in your country?

Maintaining a single website for a whole country can reduce maintenance efforts. Example: [R-Ladies en MÃ©xico](https://rladiesmx.netlify.app/).

Furthermore, if you list the contact information of all chapters, it might mean a potential external collaborator might contact all chapters at once instead of e.g. only emailing the chapter in the capital of the country.

You can also use it to promote [inter-chapter activities](/organization/events/general/#inter-chapter-events).
