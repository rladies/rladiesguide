The [organizers' slack](/organization/tech/accounts/#slack) is for organizers, the [community slack](/comm/slack/) is for all R-Ladies.

You might want to create a discussion space for your own chapter on Slack or another platform.

It can be a place for discussions, collaboration, Q&As, regular scheduled messages, etc.

In this platform, make organizers easy to identify (e.g. adding "Organizer - " to your names) which is important in particular if a member wants to report an incident related to the code of conduct.

In any case encourage the members of your chapter to join the [community slack](/comm/slack/)!

If you wish the local slack workspace to be only for women and gender minorities, be explicit about it.
