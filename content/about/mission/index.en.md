**R-Ladies is a worldwide organization whose mission is to promote
gender diversity in the R community**

The R community suffers from an underrepresentation of minority genders
(including but not limited to cis/trans women, trans men, non-binary,
genderqueer, agender) in every role and area of participation, whether
as leaders, package developers, conference speakers, conference
participants, educators, or users ([see recent
stats](http://forwards.github.io/data/)).

As a diversity initiative, the mission of R-Ladies is to achieve
proportionate representation by encouraging, inspiring, and empowering
people of genders currently underrepresented in the R community.
R-Ladies' primary focus, therefore, is on supporting minority gender R
enthusiasts to achieve their programming potential, by building a
collaborative global network of R leaders, mentors, learners, and
developers to facilitate individual and collective progress worldwide.
