As a reminder, there can be no partnerships between the R-Ladies organization (including chapters) and DataCamp. 

We also do not promote the use of DataCamp or offer its products (even if they are free) to our community and using our official channels (social networks, emails, website).

For more context on the disapproval of DataCamp by the R-Ladies organization, please refer to the two statements on our blog.
