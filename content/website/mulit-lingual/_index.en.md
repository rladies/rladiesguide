R-Ladies global website is set up to support multiple languages.
This means that the site can be translated into different languages, and users can switch between them.
The site currently only supports English, but Spanish, French, and Portuguese translations are in progress.

## Set-up of multi-lingual support

The multi-lingual support is set up using the [Hugo multilingual mode](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/).

Translations are done in two main ways:

- **Using the `i18n` folder**: This is used for translating static strings in the site, such as menu items, titles, and other UI elements.
- **Using the `content` folder**: This is used for translating the content of the site, such as pages and posts.

## Work in progress

The multi-lingual support is a work in progress, and we welcome contributions to help improve it.
If you would like to contribute to the translations, please check the [language review](review/) page for more information on how to contribute.
The process is still being refined, so please bear with us as we work on it.
We are also looking for volunteers to help with the translations, so if you are interested, please let us know.
