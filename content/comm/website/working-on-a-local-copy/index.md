If you are working on your own local copy (as a clone of the main repository - remember to make your own branch, see [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/) for more information for tips) - the site should be rendered with hugo directly.
This website is developed for hugo, and not R-packages like blogdown or hugodown. 

To render the site locally, open a terminal and use: 

```bash
hugo serve
```
Open a browser and enter the localhost address to see the rendered page.

If you are working from RStudio, the project can be opened in Rstudio as you would normally a blogdown/hugodown site, but instead of serving the site through the R console, open a terminal-tab in the console panel and type the above command.
