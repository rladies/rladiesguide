Adding new press entries means adding a new markdown entry in `content/activities/press`.
This is a folder where there are subfolders for each press entry. 
Each folder is a date of a press entry (if there are multiple entries for the same date, please append the folder name with the media outlet name).
For instance: `2021-10-30-times` `2021-10-30-buzzfeed` `2021-12-23`

Inside this folder, there should be a single `index.md` with the following information in the yaml

```
---
title: "El aporte silencioso a la agroinform√°tica"
date: 2017-06-26
source: "http://ria.inta.gob.ar/contenido/el-aporte-silencioso-la-agroinformatica"
categories: "es"
---
```

 - *title*: Article title in original language
 - *date*: date the article was published (YYY-MM-DD)
 - *source*: full URL to the article
 - *categories*: the language the article is in [HTML ISO](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp)

Additionally, if there is a pdf available of the article, this can be placed in the same folder as the `index.md` file. It could in theory have the same name, but please give it a sensible name so that when someone accesses it the file name is meaningful. 
For instance `2021-10-31-times-the-article-title.pdf` 
As long as it is a pdf, the link to the pdf will appear on the press page.
