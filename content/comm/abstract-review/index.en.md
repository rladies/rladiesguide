R-Ladies Global has a system for review and feedback of conference abstracts and funding opportunities for both R-related and domain-specific conferences. To encourage R-Ladies to submit proposals and improve chances of having work or applications selected, 80 international reviewers provide constructive feedback on areas including topics and pitch, phrasing, and subject matter.

## User/volunteer facing docs

* [Submit a proposal/abstract for review](https://rladies.org/form/abstract-request/) ( Please request feedback no later than three weeks before your conference deadline. )
