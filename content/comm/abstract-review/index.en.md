R-Ladies Global has a system for review and feedback of conference abstracts and funding opportunities for both R-related and domain-specific conferences. To encourage R-Ladies to submit proposals and improve chances of having work or applications selected, 80 international reviewers provide constructive feedback on areas including topics and pitch, phrasing, and subject matter.
