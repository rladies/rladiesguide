R-Ladies Global has a system for review and feedback of conference abstracts and funding opportunities for both R-related and domain-specific conferences. To encourage R-Ladies to submit proposals and improve chances of having work or applications selected, 80 international reviewers provide constructive feedback on areas including topics and pitch, phrasing, and subject matter.

## User/volunteer facing docs

* [Submit a proposal/abstract for review](https://rladies.org/form/abstract-request/) ( Please request feedback no later than three weeks before your conference deadline. )

* [Become a reviewer](https://rladies.org/form/abtract-volunteer/)

## Behind-the-scenes

### Promotion

The system can be promoted on R-Ladies social media once in a while, 
in particular before big conference deadlines, 

* By R-Ladies social media

* In the [organizers slack](/organization/tech/accounts/#slack)

* In the [community slack](/comm/slack/)

* And anywhere where it might be useful.

### Coordination

The current volunteer in charge of the system uses a Trello board for tracking 
review requests.
