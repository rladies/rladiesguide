As stated in the [R Contributor website](https://contributor.r-project.org/working-group){target="_blank"}: 

> The R Contribution Working Group (RCWG) is a collaboration between R Core, R community groups (including Forwards, the R Community Diversity and Inclusion Working Group, R-Ladies, MiR) and members of the wider R community. Its aim is to encourage new contributors to R core, with a focus on diversity and inclusion.

The R-Ladies Global Team aims to have a team member join the R Contribution 
Working Group. Responsibilities include:

* Attending meetings when you can.

* Posting a summary of highlights from the RCWG meeting on the `#r-project-inclusion` on the R-Ladies community Slack (picking this up from the minutes if you are unable to attend).

* Otherwise engaging in RCWG initiatives as you feel able.
