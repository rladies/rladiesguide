The site is configured using a [config directory](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/#configuration-directory) rather than a single config-file. 
This makes is easier to create large custom configurations but keep the structure clean.

In particular, the config directory makes it easier to keep the menu definitions for the different site languages distinct.
