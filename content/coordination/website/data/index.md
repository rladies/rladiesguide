The site used hugo [data templates](https://gohugo.io/templates/data-templates/#readout) for several purposes.

- Mentoring program  
- Event data  
- Chapter information  
- Month name translations

Hugo data template source data are found in the `data` folder, where we have chosen to use `.json` files for this purpose. 

Of these, only the mentoring program has a file that is updated manually by R-Ladies global team members working with the mentoring program. 

The month names are also created by us, but once created should not need changes as long as they are correct. The month name jsons are used when site language is switched, for displaying the correct month names in the chosen language.
