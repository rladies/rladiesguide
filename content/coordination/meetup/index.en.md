## Goal

The goal of this activity is to create and monitor chapters on the meetup.com
platform. The person in charge needs to be able to commit a few hours weekly. 
Ideally, this will become a team of at least 2 people, to split the workload
and guarantee requests are addressed any time of the year.

## Why do we use Meetup?

Meetup might not be well-known to you or your region, but it has been a very 
important platform for many to establish a community. Members can "join" your 
chapter's page and then subscribe to all your events. This makes it easier 
for people to never miss an event announcement. 

While you may prefer using other platforms that reach more people in your area,
we still require you to register your events on Meetup. Meetup provides the 
most straight forward way for the Global team to obtain information about chapter
activity and members. Despite these numbers likely not 100% reflecting chapter 
memberships, at minimum we can have a singular platform where events are registered.
Registering events on Meetup enables the Global Team to create chapter activity reports
required for our funders. These reports are then used to justify a continuation (or modification, 
if needed) of our funding agreement. These funds are used to pay for for global operations,
 including Meetup, Zoom, E-Mails, Website hosting, Calendly for bookings, and more.

A Meetup account is also a requirement for the chapter to be eligible for the [RConsortium RUGs grants](https://www.r-consortium.org/all-projects/r-user-group-support-program). 

Thank you for helping the Global Team track chapter activity so that we may continue
to secure the funding that serves this community.

## What to do

-   Monitor the notifications of \@rladies/meetup-pro on GitHub.
    You were added to that team during your onboarding process to R-Ladies
    Global. The Chapter Onboarding team will mention \@rladies/meetup-pro 
    in the issue of the [new-chapters-onboarding repository](https://github.com/rladies/new-chapters-onboarding/issues) where the
    prospective chapter is being created.
    
-   When a request is made, activate a
    new meetup group for the chapter following  the instructions in [Appendix A](#appendix-a-new-meetupcom-page-template). During your onboarding
    process you were granted the necessary credentials. 

-   Once the chapter is activated on meetup.com, let the organiser know
    via a DM on Slack. The Chapter Onboarding team will let you know the 
    name of the organizer(s). You can also find that information in the 
    email where the request to open the chapter was made (emails to `chapters@rladies.org` are forwarded to your rladies.org email account). 
    See [Appendix B](#appendix-b-message-template) for 
    a message template (make sure you adapt the template with the correct
    name of the chapter).

-   The organiser is expected to join the meetup group, so that you can
    make them a co-organiser. In order to do that:

    -   Go to the meetup page for the chapter

    -   Then click on 'N members' (see red oval shape in the screenshot
        below)

![Screenshot of the meetup page of a chapter where the number of members is written below the location](image4.png)

-   In the list, locate the member you want to make a co-organiser and
    click the three dots next to the name
        
![Screenshot of the organizers list, near every person's name are three dots](image2.png)

-   Click 'Change member role'
    
-   Select 'co-organiser' and click on 'Update role'

![Screenshot of the checkboxes for choosing roles](image1.png)


-   Post the Meetup url in the issue dedicated to creating the chapter
    on the [new-chapters-onboarding repository](https://github.com/rladies/new-chapters-onboarding/issues). Check the tasks listed
    there, so the Chapter Onboarding team knows when this part
    of the process is ready. 

-   If any **meetup-related problems** arise, please liaise with
    the R-Ladies dedicated Account Manager for Meetup Pro. You 
    will find their email on the Wiki of the [New Chapters Onboarding
    repository](https://github.com/rladies/new-chapters-onboarding/).
    Examples of problems we have experienced:

    -   The name of the city is not available in the meetup database
        which prevents us from creating the meetup page. Sometimes,
        you have to check spelling in different languages. If that
        does not work, our Account Manager will be able to add the 
        city to the database manually.

    -   If you are trying to **re-activate a chapter that was previously
        retired**, meetup won't allow you to use the standard string
        for the chapter's url (rladies-cityname). In this case you should
        contact our Account Manager. If you have already created a new page,
        please ask them to change the custom address to the standard
        rladies-cityname.

-   Periodically **monitor content on meetup**:

    -   Things to check:

        -   Every chapter has at least one co-organiser (if there are no
            co-organisers, let the leadership know as this chapter
            will need to retire)

        -   No cis-men should be made co-organisers or assistant 
        organizer.

        -   Make sure people do not abuse the R-Ladies org. For instance,
            please check that chapters are not run by companies
            under the hood.

    -   If there are any problems, please contact the organiser to ask
        for clarification. If the situation cannot be sorted in a
        friendly way, then report to the leadership team
        on the #team-global channel, and we will help you find a way
        forward. If you are not sure about something (e.g., the chapter
        content is in a language you don't speak), please seek for
        advice onn the #team-global channel. 

-   **Delete chapter pages if necessary**. 

    -   The Chapter Monitoring Team will periodically provide you with the
        list of inactive chapters to retire.

    -   A chapter page on meetup will need to be deleted if the chapter is
        not following R-Ladies mission and guidelines (e.g. is run by a
        company, charges for events, etc). 

-   **Keep the record on GitHub always up-to-date**
    (<https://github.com/rladies/rladies.github.io/tree/main/data/chapters>).
    This means adding new chapters to the list, or changing their
    status from Prospective to Active or from Active to Retired. 
    

### Appendix A: New meetup.com page template

#### Step1: What\'s your new Meetup Group\'s hometown?

**City, Country (ISO2 Code)**


#### Step 2: What will your Meetup be about?

Meetup doesn't always show the same categories. But usually Technology or
Data Science are displayed. You will be able to add R related topics in one of the steps below.

**Category: Technology or Data Science**

#### Step 3: What will your Meetup\'s name be?

Name: **R-Ladies City**. 

By default meetup will create a page

This URL will be changed in one of the steps below.

#### Step 4: Describe who should join, and what your Meetup will do.

```markdown
This is a local chapter of R-Ladies Global (https://www.rladies.org), an organisation that promotes gender diversity in the R community worldwide. We meetup in person or virtually to learn about the R programming language, algorithms and advanced tools. 

R-Ladies welcomes members of all R proficiency levels, whether you're a new or aspiring R user, or an experienced R programmer interested in mentoring, networking & expert upskilling. Our community is designed to develop our members' R skills & knowledge through social, collaborative learning & sharing. Supporting minority identity access to STEM skills & careers, the Free Software Movement, and contributing to the global R community!

We are pro-actively inclusive of queer, trans, and all minority identities, with additional sensitivity to intersectional identities. Our priority is to provide a safe community space for anyone identifying as a minority gender who is interested in working with R. As a founding principle, there is no cost or charge to participate in any of our R-Ladies communities around the world. You can access our presentations, R scripts, and Projects on our Github account (https://github.com/rladies) and follow us on Mastodon (https://hachyderm.io/@RLadiesGlobal) to stay up to date about R-Ladies news!

Make sure you read and comply with our code of conduct (https://rladies.org/coc/) and community guidelines (https://guide.rladies.org/about/mission/#r-ladies-rules--guidelines).

Please note that by taking part in an R-Ladies event you grant the community organizers full rights to use the images resulting from the photography/video filming/media, and any reproductions or adaptations of the images for publicity, fundraising or other purposes to help achieve the community's aims. This might include (but is not limited to), the right to use them in their printed and online publicity, social media, press releases and funding applications. If you do not wish to be recorded in these media please inform a community organizer.
```

```markdown
Hi and welcome to R-Ladies!

Your chapter is set up on Meetup:

- Link: ADD MEETUP LINK

Things to keep in mind/to know:

- Please visit the website and click on the button "Join Group". Let me know when you become a member of the group, so that I can make you an organizer with full admin rights. The page contains some standard text in English that you can customise or translate. 

- Once your meetup group is established, please hold your first event within the next 6 months. After that, please keep your chapter active with at least one event every 6 months. For comparison, many chapters do an event every 2-3 months and some chapters do monthly events. If you find yourself struggling with the 6 months frequency, you can seek for advice in the #organizers channel on Slack or you can join our Mentoring Program. 

- Every time you run an event publish it into your chapter Meetup account. This will keep the chapter active. Only events published on Meetup are considered as chapter activity (because these are the ones we can keep track of).
    
- The R-Ladies Guide has a whole [section about organizing events](https://guide.rladies.org/organization/events/general/). There, you'll find useful information, such as tips for planning and promoting events, instructions for using the R-Ladies Zoom account, etc.
    
- The [RLadies Guide](https://guide.rladies.org/organization/tech/brand/) also has a section about our branding materials, like official logos, color palettes, presentation templates, stickers, etc. 

- When there is any change in your group (e.g., create social media accounts, etc) please, update the info here: https://github.com/rladies/rladies.github.io/tree/main/data/chapters. This is the place where the chapter info is stored so make sure it is up to date.

- If needed, we can create a GitHub repo for your chapter on the R-Ladies GitHub Organization. You can request it in the #new-chapters channel. 

- Please remember that the R-Ladies Organizers Slack is our prefered channel of communication. 

Regarding adding new organizers to your chapter:

- Probably in the next few weeks/months new organizers will be joining your team. There is a section in the [R-Ladies Guide](https://guide.rladies.org/organization/intro/co-organizers/#how-to-onboard-organizers) with all the information you need to know about how to onboard them. This the only official way to add a co-organizer


If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us. The #organizers channel on Slack is also a great place to seek for advise.

**Thank you for being part of the R-Ladies community!**
