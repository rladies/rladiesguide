## Donations

When someone sends an email inquiring about larger donations, offer to

- provide them the routing/account number for a direct wire transfer,

- or if they are in the US and prefer to send a check, we can provide them our non-profit HQ address in Oakland, California.

How to acknowledge the donation?

- Of course, thank the donator in the email communication.

- If the donator is comfortable with a public acknowledgement, add their name to our future website.

- If the donator is comfortable with a public acknowledgement, have the volunteer(s) in charge of our global Twitter account or other social media channel prepare a tweet/communication draft. Have the donator validate the draft.
