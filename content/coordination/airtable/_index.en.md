Airtable is a powerful, flexible database tool that combines the simplicity of a spreadsheet with the advanced functionality of a relational database.
It allows users to organize, store, and manage data efficiently while enabling collaboration across teams. Each **base** in Airtable acts as a workspace containing **tables**, which hold structured data similar to spreadsheets.
However, unlike traditional spreadsheets, Airtable supports **linked records**, **custom field types** (such as attachments, checkboxes, and dates), and **automations** to streamline workflows.
Users can also create **forms** to collect data, apply **filters and views** to customize how information is displayed, and set up **automations** to send emails, update records, or trigger actions based on predefined conditions.
Whether managing projects, tracking inventory, or planning events, Airtable provides a user-friendly yet powerful way to structure and interact with data.

The R-Ladies Global team uses Airtable for a lot of internal project tracking, from the Rotating Curation on Bluesky, to Directory management, the Abstract Review programs, as well as other internal processes.
This document is intended for our team members to learn some general tips about Airtable, and more project specific documentation is elsewhere.

A really nice introduction to Airtable [can be found on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq3rQpodt58).
