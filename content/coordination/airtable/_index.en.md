The R-Ladies Global team uses Airtable for a lot of internal project tracking, from the Rotating Curation on Bluesky, to Directory management, the Abstract Review programs, as well as other internal processes.
This document is intended for our team members to learn some general tips about Airtable, and more project specific documentation is elsewhere.

A really nice introduction to Airtable [can be found on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq3rQpodt58).
