This document details the updated structure and functionality of the "abstract review" Airtable base, used to manage requests for abstract reviews and the team of volunteers who provide the reviews. It now utilizes a central "tasks" table to manage the review workload, linking abstracts and volunteers. The base involves two tables, each populated by a dedicated form, and includes updated automations.
